Hard:
1. Operate up to 4 motors bidirectionally with the pins available to you (listed in the power pinout table). You will need to control 2x motors which could each draw 
       200mA at the highest voltage of a 1S1P battery (the battery is further specified in the battery section). The other 2x motors are for the auxiliary connection and need 
       to operate 500mA each.
2. Integrate USB C and get 9V out of the USB Host.
Medium:
1. Place an INA219 for monitoring the battery on the I2C Bus and configure it correctly with
respect to the hardware (cannot have BOTH A0 AND A1 on GND)
Chillin:
1. Provide a 3V3 and 5V Out.
