Design PCB Requirements
  Hard:
    1. Have two charging modes for a higher and lower charging current for the battery(200mA, and approximately 600mA Â±100mA.
    2. Provide an ON/OFF switch. OFF state: battery draw <30uA. ON state: can provide your robot peak current.The switch needs to shut down 5V and 3V3.
  Medium:
    1. Provide 2x External Load Switching at 1A each.
  Chillin:
    1. Charge the battery from the 9V input pin (listed in the power pinout table)
