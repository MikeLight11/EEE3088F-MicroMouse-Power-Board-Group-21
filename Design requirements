Design PCB Requirements
  Hard:
    1. Operate up to 4 motors bidirectionally with the pins available to you (listed in the power pinout table). You will need to control 2x motors which could each draw 
       200mA at the highest voltage of a 1S1P battery (the battery is further specified in the battery section). The other 2x motors are for the auxiliary connection and need 
       to operate 500mA each.
    2. Have two charging modes for a higher and lower charging current for the battery(200mA, and approximately 600mA Â±100mA.
    3. Integrate USB C and get 9V out of the USB Host.
    4. Provide an ON/OFF switch. OFF state: battery draw <30uA. ON state: can provide your robot peak current.The switch needs to shut down 5V and 3V3.
  Medium:
    1. Provide 2x External Load Switching at 1A each.
    2. Place an INA219 on the I2C Bus and configure it correctly with respect to the hardware.
  Chillin:
    1. Charge the battery from the 9V input pin (listed in the power pinout table)
    2. Provide a 3V3 and 5V Out.
